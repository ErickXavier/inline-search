= jQuery Inline Search

Search inline elements using a tiny, fast, and effective jQuery plugin.
Tested with jQuery 1.3.1

== Examples

  <ul class="users">
    <li>Joe</li>
    <li>Bob</li>
    <li>Joey</li>
    <li>Scott</li>
  </ul>
  
The following will hide all users li items
other than Joe and Joey.

  $('.users li').search('Joe')
  
The search below will show only Joe since
they are filtered by keyword.

  $('.users li').search('Joe', 'by keyword')
  
Joe and Scott will be shown:

  $('.users li').search('Joe Scott', 'by keyword')
  
Alternatively you may create your own filters, by
using an anonymous function closure, or registering
it with $.search.filters .

When the filter returns true the element will be filtered.

  $('.users li').search('Bob', function(search){
    return ! $.inArray(this.text().split(' '), search)
  })
  
In more complex cases you may need to filter on child elements,
while hiding parent elements when filtered. This is possible using
the 'remove' option. The 'remove' function is called in context to
the element being filtered on, which in this case is the 'td.first-name'
so we remove it's parent which will be a 'tr', since we would not
want to simply hide the 'td'.

  var parent = function(){ return this.parent() }
  $('table.users td.first-name').search('Tyler', 'by keyword', { remove : parent })
  
Lookup functions are also built into Inline Search, so instead of creating parent
like we did above, simply use 'parent'.

  $('table.users td.first-name').search('Tyler', 'by keyword', { remove : 'parent' })
  
== Core filters

  - 'by substring' : default
  - 'by keyword'   : entire words
  
== Core lookup functions

  - 'parent' : elements parent
