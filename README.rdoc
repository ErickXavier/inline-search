= jQuery Inline Search

Search inline elements using a tiny, fast, and effective jQuery plugin.

== Examples

  <ul class="users">
    <li>Joe</li>
    <li>Bob</li>
    <li>Joey</li>
    <li>Scott</li>
  </ul>
  
The following will hide all users li items
other than Joe and Joey.

  $('.users li').search('Joe')
  
The search below will show only Joe since
they are filtered by keyword.

  $('.users li').search('Joe', 'by keyword')
  
Joe and Scott will be shown:

  $('.users li').search('Joe Scott', 'by keyword')
  
Alternatively you may create your own filters, by
using an anonymous function closure, or registering
it with $.search.filters .

When the filter returns true the element will be filtered.

  $('.users li').search('Bob', function(search){
    return ! $.inArray(this.text().split(' '), search)
  })
